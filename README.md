### Abstract
**Agent-I** is an application designed to streamline customer support. Companies get thousands of customer support emails every single day. Most of these emails are questions that are similar in format.

> *My order id is 1621, I've cancelled this order and haven't received a refund yet. When can I expect my refund?*

Responding to such emails take time, even with pre-made templates. A customer service associate would have to look up the customer's information through an application that queries the customer information database and fill in the template. **Agent-I** uses cutting-edge technology to read and understand customer emails.


> *The phone I was delivered is broken! I want to return this, how do I do that?*

**Agent-I** gathers the neccessary information from business specific data warehouses and generates ready-to-send email templates that a Customer Service Associate can review and send.

### User Stories
- Sally is a newly hired customer service associate. She has extensive experience in customer service but is new to the company's customer information retrieval software. Luckily her company is using **Agent-I** to generate emails tailored for the customer. She receives her first customer support email. **Agent-I** analyzes the customers mood and retrieves information pertaining to the customer's query. A ready-to-send email is presented to Sally to review. She takes a quick look and presses send. The customer receives a quick response and Sally is left to do more important tasks.

- Bob is a senior customer service associate. He's been using **Agent-I** for a long time. Most of the time he is happy to send the generated emails without further modifications, but sometimes he likes to modify the emails to make them more personal. **Agent-I** has adapted to the changes that he has made and over time he has had to make less changes. Bob now sets up **Agent-I** to automatically send generated emails. He is able to fine-tune which kinds of enqueries receive an automatic responds and which require his review. He now has more time than ever to respond to customer calls and more involved tasks.

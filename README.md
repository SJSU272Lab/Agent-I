## Project: ______

### Abstract
______ is an application designed to streamline customer support. Companies get thousands of customer support emails every single day. Most of these emails are questions that are similar in format (ie. My order id is 123abc, I've cancelled this order and haven't received a refund yet. When can I expect my refund?). Responding to these kind of emails take time, even with pre-made templates. ____ uses cutting-edge AI technology to read and understand customer emails. ____ gathers the neccessary information from business specific data warehouses and generates ready-to-send email templates that a Customer Service Associate can review and send.
